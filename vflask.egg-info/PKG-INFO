        vFlask allows developers to deploy their flask application without the need for updating the environment vairables which is a PAIN IN THE ASS setup.
        
        -> vFlask allows the developers to just specify the root or app directory name to the CLI and define the __main__ method inside the __init__.py of the flask application with their specific implementation
        -> app/__init__.py
            #Your code goes here
        
            if __name__ == "__main__":
                #your function
        
        -> vFlask uses the Flask's default directory namespace i.e., developers no need to specify the directory name if its "app" else respective option is provided to specify the directory name
        
        -> vFlask support proper implementation, which is why it suggests to use uWSGI implementation for PRODUCTION environment, with help of "uwsgi-config" option to CLI which specifies the name of wsgi_config.ini file.
